------ Memory layout -------
== Mappings ==
+ 0x0-0x100000000    - Anything, 4GiB mapped.
+ 
+ (4 level paging)
+ 0xffff800000000000 - Pointers (example: RSDP, gterm variables), 2GiB mapped.
+ 
+ 0xffffd00000000000 - Kernel heap, 4GiB mapped.
+
+ 0xffffffff80200000 - Kernel code, 2GiB mapped.

== Allocators ==
+ 1: bitmap allocator, used as a generic allocator for one time or very few allocations  SIZE: Covers the entire memory map
+ 2: buddy allocator, used for performance critical allocations. uses the bitmap allocator for memory ranges and the slab for .
+ 3: slab (heap) allocator, used primarly for cached, fine grained allocations based on powers of two (2).
+    Plays an important role of the initialization of zones and the buddy allocator. SIZE: 1MiB
