== Mappings ==
+ 0x0-0x40000000     - Anything, 4GiB mapped.
+ 
+ (4 level paging)
+ 0xffff800000000000 - Pointers, heaps, structures, etc, 2GiB mapped.
+ 
+ (5 level paging)
+ 0xff00000000000000 - Pointers, heaps, structures, etc, 2GiB mapped.
+ 
+ 0xffffffff80200000 - Kernel code, 2GiB mapped.

== Allocators ==
+ 1: bitmap allocator, used as an early boot allocator to init the slab heap. SIZE: Covers the entire memory map
+ 2: buddy allocator, used as a pmm. 										  SIZE: Covers the entire memory map
+ 3: slab (heap) allocator, used primarly for cached, fine grained allocations based on powers of two (2).
+    Plays an important role of the initialization of zones and the buddy allocator. SIZE: 1MiB
